# A Card Deck

This is a library (maybe) that provide you to create card games. I'm aiming for compatible with `Tien Len`, `Blackjack`, `Poker`, and `UNO` as a rare exception.

**It is still in development stage, so chill.**

## How to use

- Inherit `Card`, then override the constructor, the operators overloading.
- Inherit `Game`, then override `gameRule`.
