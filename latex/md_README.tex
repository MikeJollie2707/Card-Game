This is a library (maybe) that provide you to create card games. I\textquotesingle{}m aiming for compatible with {\ttfamily Tien Len}, {\ttfamily Blackjack}, {\ttfamily Poker}, and {\ttfamily U\+NO} as a rare exception.

{\bfseries It is still in development stage, so chill.}

\subsection*{How to use}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Inherit {\ttfamily Card}, then override the constructor, the operators overloading.
\item Inherit {\ttfamily Game}, then override {\ttfamily game\+Rule}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
